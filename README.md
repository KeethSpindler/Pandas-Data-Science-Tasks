# Pandas Tutorial

## Introduction
As the number of data sources increase in the world, so too will the demand to caputr, transform and analyze it into useable information. Though I have small experience in the field, I aspire to become profieicnt common Data Science tools, such as pandas and matplotlib libraries, so that I can thoroughly comprehend large amounts of data and make powerful inferences through the information it holds.

## Goal
This repository will hold my work as I follow Keith Galli's "Solving real world data science tasks with Python Pandas!" Youtube tutorial video. As I move along in the video, I will attempt to challenge myself to not only answer the questions provided, but also ask and answer new ones I create myself along the way.
